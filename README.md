# TowerDefense
This repository holds all the files used in creating a tower defense game in Python. It utilizes the PyGame Library.

It has some bugs and currently the frame rate on macs limits the game so it seems a bit slow. On Windows the game operates smoothly and as intended (it was made on Windows). I have yet to circumvent this issue. It's currently at a solid version that works fully, but optimization and additions are still needed.

Necessary Software:
>> For MACS:
    - Updated version of python 2
    - Pygame for python 2 (pygame is not available on MACS for Python 3)
>> For WINDOWS:
    - Updated version of python 3 (recommended)
    - Most updated version of Pygame
  
File to run: 'TowerGame.py'
